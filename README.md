# NHTSA

A text analysis on consumer complaints from the NHTSA website.

The original purpose of this analysis was to investigate the prevelance of spontaneous fire complaints in the 2005 Chevolet Colorado, as my own vehicle burst into flames in my driveway and damaged my house. Findings: 22.1% of complaints include both keywords "fire" and "blower".
